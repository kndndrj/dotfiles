# .dotfiles

Various dotfiles for my everyday setup. Don't use the repo as is...
if you find something interesting, do a little copy-paste instead!

## Usage Reminder

1. Clone repo
2. Install `stow`
3. Create symlinks
   ```sh
   stow -t $HOME/ dotfiles/linux
   stow -t $HOME/ dotfiles/common
   ...
   ```
